### âš¡ What I do 

As a web developer, I specialize in creating custom solutions that bring your business ideas to life. With expertise in translating design concepts from Figma to the web, I can turn your vision into a functional and visually appealing website or application that meets your specific needs.

My Github is empty simply because I'm very busy with work and learning new things after.
Old repositories were deleted, because they didn't represent my current skills.
